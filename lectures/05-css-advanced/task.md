# CSS Advanced practice

You need adjust our CV using CSS advanced features and BEM [Figma Design](<https://www.figma.com/file/Ntbk8Uf7XzjmWOkSh9Q8Y7/simply-portfolio-desing-(Community)>).

### Definition of done

- Should be used [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) approach for CSS classes
- Layout should be responsive and have a good look on mobile/tablet screens as well
- Mobile layout should be on screens width up to 600px, tablet - up to 1024px
- Should be added fixed button “scroll to top” on mobile view to the bottom of the page
- It would be great if you can add three types of animations to your page(transition, keyframe, js). You can add them where you imagine it.

Good luck!
