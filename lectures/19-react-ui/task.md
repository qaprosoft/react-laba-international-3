(You have to sign up to see the styles. Let me know if you have any issues.)

Avatar app: where possible to add more tiles with random avatars or refresh all tiles. Use https://tinyfac.es/. Design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/HJtTPFc67QoIF82yIqoB1T/%5BHomework%5D-Class-and-Functional-Components?node-id=0%3A1&t=wItenMikHEiPGOlV-1). Assets are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1UywgqalcaJKoix3U8Jt4ugembn2L0gps).

AC:

- As a user I would like to be able to add the tile with random avatar
- As a user I would like to be able to refresh the avatar
- As a user I would like to be able to refresh all avatars

Good Luck!
