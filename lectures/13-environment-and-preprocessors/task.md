# CSS Preprocessors & Environment

## Description

Remember your [04-css](https://github.com/qaprosoft/react-laba-international-2/tree/main/lectures/04-css#readme) task?) You need to prepare module bundler to build scss or stylus code. It can be any module bundler: Webpack, Parcel, Browserify, etc.

So, I need a project that has 2 scripts: `npm run build` and `npm start`. When you run `npm start` there should be a watcher for scss or stylus files.

`npm run build` should make compressed CSS files.

So, what about your [04-css](https://github.com/qaprosoft/react-laba-international-2/tree/main/lectures/04-css#readme) task? Rewrite your CSS styles into `scss` or `stylus`.
