(You have to sign up to see the styles. Let me know if you have any issues.)

Avatar app: where possible to add more tiles with random avatars or refresh all tiles. Use https://tinyfac.es/. Design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/HJtTPFc67QoIF82yIqoB1T/%5BHomework%5D-Class-and-Functional-Components?node-id=0%3A1&t=wItenMikHEiPGOlV-1). Assets are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1UywgqalcaJKoix3U8Jt4ugembn2L0gps).

AC:

- Use styles from previous homeworks
- Use Next.js (use pages router)
- Load 5 avatars for initial load using SSR and SSG (create two separate pages for it, e.g. /ssr and /ssg)
- Deploy your application on any free host. (Example.)[https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/deploying-nextjs-app]

Good Luck!
