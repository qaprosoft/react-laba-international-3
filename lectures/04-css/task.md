# CSS practice

Create HTML page using provided [Figma Design](<https://www.figma.com/file/Ntbk8Uf7XzjmWOkSh9Q8Y7/simply-portfolio-desing-(Community)>).

### Definition of done

- The HTML and CSS should pass W3C [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validations
- The page structure should be semantically correct and includes most of HTML5 elements (header, nav, section, main and footer)
- Page should look good on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox) on desktop screens.
- You should use [BEM approach](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/)

### Optional (advanced)

- Implement dark mode functionality

Good luck!
