## Codewars

Here's some codewars' tasks

1. [Error Throwing - Error Handling #2](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55e7650c8d894146be000095/javascript)
2. [Jokes you've been 'awaiting' for ... promise](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a353a478f27f244a1000076)

Please include these two codewars tasks in one file in PR:

```javascript
// task 1 link
function solution1() {
  // your code's here
}

// task 2 link
function solution2() {
  // your code's here
}
```

## 3. setTimeout/setInterval

1st part of the task:  
You need to create an interval to display the number of seconds that have passed since the program was started to the console.  
‘Elapsed time: 1 sec’  
‘Elapsed time: 2 sec’ ... etc.

2nd part of the task:  
Write the program in that way it stops when reaching 5 seconds and the elapsed time is no longer displayed on the console.

## 4. Event Loop

Please review this video(few times!!!):  
[What the heck is the event loop anyway? | Philip Roberts | JSConf EU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ&vl=en)

Play around with this service and see how Event Loop works:

## 5. Fetch API/XMLHttpRequest

Write a script that requests with the help of https://randomuser.me/ and displays a list of users with the information about them below.  
The layout may be very simple, whatever you like, to see the result.  
The request might look like this:  
`https://randomuser.me/api/?gender=female&results=10`  
Please, make two different scripts, one using Fetch, the other XMLHttpRequest  
UI may look like this (you choose):

## Regular expressions

### 6. Digit or not

Write a function that receives a variable containing a string, as a parameter and checks whether the contents of this variable begin with a digit or not, using a regular expression.

### 7. Optional (advanced)

Check if this entry is a phone number, e.g. set the format of your country:  
Argentina: +54 xxx-xxxx-xxx

### 8. Optional (advanced)

Play [Regex Cross­word](https://regexcrossword.com/)  
P.S. you don't need to create any files for Regex Crossword. Just try it for fun and when you have free time.
