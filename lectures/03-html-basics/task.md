# HTML practice

Create HTML page using provided [Figma Design](<https://www.figma.com/file/rDDQzjMzAjQL5NYzCQDiXd/Simple-portfolio-(only-HTML)>).

### Definition of done

- You can use only HTML (no CSS or JS or something else).
- HTML should pass W3C [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) validations. HTML should be semantic.
- Add work navigation between pages.
- Put your photo instead of "YOUR PHOTO HERE" on the template. Photo should not take all page.
- Full name and phone inputs should be required values on the form. This means that you can't send a form without these values.
- Don't be a Pixel Perfect. Don't be worry about it.
- Don't need to send data anywhere. Just miss this.

Good luck!
