# Solvd React Laba International 2024

This repository contains all information about the lectures, workshops and other useful information
for course.

## Structure

Please create a new repository for your homework submissions. Inside this repository, there should
be a folder named `homeworks`. The Sub-folder should have the same name as a lecture name.

## Pull Requests

### Naming

Every branch in upstream must starts with a prefix that is based on user initials. For example, for
a developer Mykhailo Melnyk prefix would be `mm-`. In case of prefix collisions in the future the
common rule is to dive deeper into the last name, for example: `mmel-`. Pattern for branch should be
`mmel-{lecture_number}-{letcture_name}`. For example, `mmel-01-basics`.

### Pattern

So, for each homework, you will need to create a Pull Request and use this pattern for the
naming -**[Homework #{number}]** - **{Lecture Name}** by **{Name Surname}**

For example **[Homework #3] - HTML by Vitalii Melnyk**

### Reviews

Once PR is created you have to do the following things:

- Assign your mentor as a reviewer
- Ping the mentor about the PR ;)

### Inviting Mentors

Don't forget to invite your mentor(s) to your repository so they can access and review your work.
You can invite them by going to your repository settings and adding them as collaborators.
